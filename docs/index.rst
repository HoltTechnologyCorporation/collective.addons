Installation
############

You first need to install and activate the Plone add-on. Therefor you had to go to the
Plone 'Site Setup' adminstration area. If you got administration permissions you find a
link to it in the menu entry with your name (or 'admin'). You could reach it directly by
adding '/@@overview-controlpanel' to the URL of your Plone site.

In the 'Site Setup' page click on 'Add-ons' and you get a list of the Plone add-ons which
are available in your Plone site.
